I realized that I was very very unprepared going into my first two tech interviews
Lessons for next time:
- Make sure I am able to explain my projects on my resume and the tech decisions I made!
- Read the job description a few days before the interview and brush up on the topics under the *skills required* section

## Standard Chartered

### What was the new update for Python about?
I was so lost for this questions because I had never done any reading on updates to programming languages

I asked my interviewer for the answer and he told me to read up on the Global Interpreter Lock https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/


### What is the difference between an array and a list?

### Why did I choose to use MongoDB over other databases for my SpringBoot Admin Dashboard application?
Help I chose MongoDB because it appeared in some tutorials for SpringBoot Applications and at this point, I hadn't touched software development before so I just went with the flow. I was honest with this but also questioning myself about why I had not done more research on MongoDB during the entire span of the project.

## Illumina

### Is a class a reference data type?
This was quite easy to guess but it made me wonder why a class is a reference data type and how reference data types actually work.

>> hmm why are structs value data types?

### What is a garbage collector?

### What is a memory leak, in what situations might it occur, and how is it related to garbage collection?

### How did you implement the data similarity service during your internship?
oooops...this task didn't leave an impression on me and I HAVE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS ABOUT AND HOW I IMPLEMENTED IT but it is on my resume (I don't even remember putting it there :/ ) I should probably remove it

### What are some design patterns you know about? Describe them and their use cases.

oooH and I didn't know structs could be extended like classes
