Yesterday a friend asked me what I consider maturity to be. It got me thinking. 

Recently I have been thinking more about my transition to adulthood, but in a more “what new habits should I pick up?”, “what new responsibilities should I take on”, “how should I find a balance between work and life, work and doing things I really feel for” kind of way. Is that all the transition to adulthood entails? It could be. But the new responsibilities, habits, the new balance don’t seem to be what constitutes maturity. 

My step into official adulthood happened in a flurry and I didn’t really make an effort to change any part of my life or myself. I turned 21 the day I flew back from exchange and with all the business of packing and getting onto the plane and the tiredness that followed, I didn’t do much reflection. As the date of starting work draws near, I think it is a good time to start thinking about the topic of maturity.

The first response I gave my friend after being asked about what I consider maturity to be was along the lines of “Being more intrinsically guided in one’s actions and a good judgment of when to be extrinsically guided.” An example would be when parents put pressure on someone to follow a certain path, for example, becoming a doctor or lawyer. According to my definition, one who is mature would only follow this path if they have an intrinsic motivation or vision to do so. But maturity comes with sensitivity to extrinsic incentives and pressures such as practical considerations (e.g. will an extrinsic reward help one further move towards one’s bigger goals). In this sense, extrinsic motivation should not be solely for the extrinsic reward, but seen as a step that is helpful for one’s own (intrinsic) goals. I think what prompted me to define maturity in this way yesterday was a quick comparison between people I perceive as more mature and less mature. Thinking a little more about this definition, it seems to boil down to the ability to be discerning.

Hmmm but now there is also the question about where intrinsic guidance comes from and if the process of developing this intrinsic guidance matters for maturity. I think all intrinsic guidance is either innate or influenced by one’s environment. One source of intrinsic guidance may be principles instilled either explicitly or implicitly by one’s parents that one adopts and comes to guide one’s actions. These principles may be mixed in with principles from friends, teachers, media, etc. and further taken apart and pieced together through reflection. Maturity calls for being aware of the sources of one’s intrinsic guidance and having a reason for holding a principle/ belief that one is guided by.

There is also the question of whether the kind of intrinsic guidance matters. Like if one is intrinsically guided to steal, is that maturity? Well duh, no. For me, mature intrinsic guidance should ultimately be guided by a larger cause one sees for. It somehow seems more mature for intrinsic guidance to be related to working towards a societal problem, something larger than oneself - similar to self-actualization in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 

Additionally, maturity requires action and not just rash action, but action that is carefully considered, responsible, and committed to. Sometimes the hardest part (for me) is translating one’s intrinsic guidance into committed action. This part requires a mix of courage, determination, independence, vision, and willingness to overcome obstacles, but also an open mind and the willingness to adapt and re-route when appropriate.

My understanding now is that maturity can be seen as good discernment (of likely consequences, of human nature, of a good balance between different extremes) alongside care and responsibility towards others, as well as well thought out action.

Notes: This is all written from my perspective. And I believe maturity looks different under different circumstances. The pursuit of self-actualization is not possible for everyone and probably not the most practical/ mature thing to do in some scenarios. But hmm this is another topic I want to think about → how the different needs in Maslow’s hierarchy relate to each other and whether a hierarchy accurately represents their relationship.
