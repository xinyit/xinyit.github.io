I had a list of topics/questions I wanted to write blog posts about. But nowadays, it is just so straightfoward to get a good explanation of most concepts from ChatGPT that I really don't see the point in writing those posts anymore. I feel like the most efficient way to "write" them would just be to type in questions to ChatGPT and make a few edits. There is just not much point in doing that.

Perhaps what matters more these days is the questions we ask. These are some of the questions I wanted asked ChatGPT about the concepts I was interested in writing blog posts about:
- Can you give a technical explanation of how a debugger works under the hood?
- How do unzipping tools work to unzip files?
- 

So moving forward, I am also not so sure what I want to write on this blog. I definitely want my posts to have originality so there might be more personal reflections and perhaps the occassional ideas I come up with.

To start off, I am going to aim to write a post per week with my consolidated reflections, ideas, learnings for the week starting this Friday! I will be starting work in 2 weeks and I am a little concerned that it will rub away at my individuality, creativity, and spontaneity. I'm hoping that writing will provide me with a medium to express my thoughts and also be a way to keep track of my learnings and ideas moving forward. Hopefully this blog with eventually be of interest to someone else in the future as well :D
