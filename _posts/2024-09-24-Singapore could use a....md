Singapore could use
- a mountain to escape to when overwhelmed by school/ work/ the city:'I
- a space for crafting and doing all kinds of visual arts (for adults) that is free and open to anyone to come anytime. Materials can be communally sourced
- affordable djembe lessons
- engaging activities to do on the mrt that isn't just endless scrolling on the phone
