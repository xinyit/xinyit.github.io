Song I have on repeat: Motherlake by JABBERLOOP

What I spent my time on: debugging this blog, doodling on paper and on my dirty white Vans, practicing juggling, listening to the audiobook version of Before the Coffee Gets Cold

One interesting thing I learnt this week: I am reading a book called Judging Machines [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e6bac9e0eedae432b177355/t/60e6369e39941a45ad0d9674/1625700043032/HHJM-Digitalversion2021-sm.pdf]
There was a part about moral psychology I found particularly interesting. The book presented two scenarios:

1. "A family dog was killed by a car in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dogâ€™s body and cooked it and ate it for dinner. Nobody saw them do this."
2. "A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a chicken. But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it."

The thing about morality is that it is so complex. 

Just before reading this, I was listening to an episode with Tommy Cladwell (a rock climber) from the podcast "A Slight Change of Plans". In it, he talked about an experience where he was held hostage and in order to escape, he pushed his captor off the side of a mountain (it wasn't that high). It got him thinking contemplating his morality -- whether he was evil or a hero for doing it. It got me thinking too. The morality of the situation is even harder to evaluate since the boundaries between what was retaliation and what was defense isn't clear.

Morality is so complicated. I wonder if there will ever be advancement in this field and if so, what will that look like? Will it involve moving towards a common morality? Do we even want a common morality? There is a lot of value in grappling with moral questions - it gets us thinking more deeply about what is good and bad. Plus I think achieving a common morality is near impossible - especially with such diverse backgrounds, experiences, and personalities. I guess what is most concerning about not having a common morality is that it could lead to conflict and that there may be a lack of basis to judge the morality of situations. But a stable, safe society can totally have moral disagreements. It is just that they should be handled with due care and there should be respect amongsts people for others(' lives).

One new idea: I want to create a new feature on this blog that provides readers with a random link (to one of my favorite websites or articles) on the click of a button. But that requires dynamically generating content so I'm not sure if it is possible. Will have to investigate heh
I used to really like this Website called Stumbleupon that would bring users to a new webpage on a click of a button. I really want to bring that back :')

Interesting interaction: On Monday I bought Sounds Fishy (a card game) on Carousell. I wasn't able to get a bargain (not that I tried very hard) so I was a little ambivalent about my decision to buy it. But the conversation with the seller made it worth it. He was quite talkative and after I asked a simple question about his favorite board game, he launched into elaborate recommendations. He recommended high society, snake oil, and funemployed; the first being a strategic trading game and the last two being supposedly hilarious persuasion games (and they certainly sound very fun with lots of room of creativity and the opportunity to brush up on persuasion skills). The conversation later turned to his Chinese and music teachers both of whom inspired in him an interest in their respective subjects. His Chinese teacher would "bait" his class to do their homework by promising to tell them stories if they did and the stories helped improve their Chinese while making them more interested in Chinese literature. His piano teacher who rewarded him by teaching him how to play his favorite songs on the piano. Hmm something about the conversation was really refreshing and I can't really identify exactly what it was -- but perhaps it was his passion for the things he talked about (board games, music), perhaps it was the vibe he gave off -- of someone who is truly living and carving out a path he wants, or just the serendipitous interaction with a stranger that really turned into an exchange of ideas, thoughts, and life experiences. 

Interesting searches:
"can you try diving from a 10m diving board singapore" -- i really want to try this

Special find: This Dark Chocolate Tahini Brownie Recipe [https://soomfoods.com/blogs/recipes/dark-chocolate-sea-salt-brownies?srsltid=AfmBOoo32jnbw9eF9i4YfhJKupMcT8A95PLTm2GokxTHDqz_BJ2fe-n8]
I usually find brownies too sweet for my liking but this one isn't! Plus it has an earthy flavor and super fudgy texture. It is also simple to make :). I didn't use the tahini from Soom foods.

Grateful for: time I have had to spend on creating, trying new things at a comfortable pace

Something I want to work on: Getting less attached to how I portray myself. Be more genuine yet thoughtful in my actions

Theme of the week: "Getting to it"
I think I have been wanting to do many things (e.g. baking, setting up this blog, tidying up my shoes) but have had inertia to do them. But this week I finally go to doing them - perhaps it is the sudden realization that I may not have as much time and capacity to do them once I start work.
