Hello there! I am Xin Yi

Some things I love: drawing (especially doodling), repurposing, climbing mountains in cooling weather with fresh air (but not the descent;;; my knees!! >< ), trying and challenging myself with new physical activities

1 October 2024: The year I am starting this blog (2024) is quite big for me. I graduated earlier this year and will be starting my first job in a week. I want to document some of my reflections, learnings, and ideas throughout this journey. 

My old blog https://sites.google.com/view/tanxinyi has bits and pieces of my thoughts on topics as love, inequality, and telegram saved messages. I also put some of my school projects up there. With this new blog, I hope to focus more on idea generation, and hope that I can strike a balance between ideas that can be practically applied and ideas that may be far fetched but may inspire other ideas. 

I wrote a post about my goals for this blog (as of Sep 24 2024): https://xinyit.github.io/posts/Questions-and-Goals/
