Each character has a strong, distinct personality and this one character, Sarah has a lot of anger and insignance at society for how it treats people with intellectual disabilities. The characters don’t hold back on voicing their opinions, leading to disagreements and tensions, which was, honestly, quite humorous. But I think underlying the comedy is a very compelling message about what “able” means and how it is very much determined by the external environment rather than a obejctive description of the individual. If powerful technologies (like AI) might give some individuals who have access to them more abilities than others, I wonder whether how we see who is more able and less able will change and whether this will affect how we see people with disabilities, both physical and intellectual. I also think the film has made me more aware of how able and insightful people classified with a intellectual disability can be, even if it may be harder to notice, and how harmful preconceived notions about people with intellectual disabilities can be.Inspiration: I was watching Strictly Ballet and there was one student who said that he really appreciated the correction given by the teachers because they were so personal. That gave me a fresh perspective on receiving feedback. I think from now on, I hope that I can see feedback that is personalized with a new lens of appreciation." }, { "title": "Weeklys #3", "url": "/posts/weeklys-3/", "categories": "Weeklys", "tags": "weeklys", "date": "2024-10-18 20:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "Song I have on repeat: Halloween by Novo AmorWhat I spent my time on: art, work, baked Tahini Brownies, went for a hip hop basics class at Converge on Tuesday, and skated from SMU to IKEA ALexandra...", "content": "Song I have on repeat: Halloween by Novo AmorWhat I spent my time on: art, work, baked Tahini Brownies, went for a hip hop basics class at Converge on Tuesday, and skated from SMU to IKEA ALexandra on FridayOne interesting thing I learnt this week: Played a word game called connect during my company’s board game night. It doesn’t require any materials.It is a one vs the rest of the group kind of gameLet’s call the one person the worderThe worder comes up with a word. The objective of the game is for the rest of the group to connect on this wordThe worder gives the first letter of their wordNow individuals from the rest of the group can think of a word starting with the letter given. They then give a clue to everyone about the word they are thinking of. If someone else from the rest of the group thinks they know the word based on the hint, they will say connect. A countdown of ten seconds is given to the worder to guess the word. If the worder guesses it, the word is eliminated and the game continues. If the worder doesn’t guess it by the end of 10 seconds, there is a 3 second countdown and then the person who gave the hint and the person who connected have to say the word at the same time. If they say the same word, the worder has to give the second letter of the word they are thinking. Now the group has to think of words starting with the first two letters given. And the game goes on.It is kind of complicated to explain but once you play it it is quite straightforward.Special find: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3UODz5O8zo" }, { "title": "Weeklys #2", "url": "/posts/weeklys-2/", "categories": "Weeklys", "tags": "weeklys", "date": "2024-10-11 20:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "Song I have on repeat: Dreams by The CranberriesWhat I spent my time on: art, work, learning house danceOne interesting thing I learnt this week: Shoshin, a concept from Zen Buddhism which means be...", "content": "Song I have on repeat: Dreams by The CranberriesWhat I spent my time on: art, work, learning house danceOne interesting thing I learnt this week: Shoshin, a concept from Zen Buddhism which means beginner’s mind. “It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying, even at an advanced level, just as a beginner would.” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin]I just feel that this mindset is something I want to actively try to adopt because I find it so easy to stray from it, especially when I feel like I have gotten comfortable with something.One new idea:Interesting interaction: I didn’t bring cash to pay for my wanton noodles at Hong Lim and only realized that the stall only accepts cash after I had ordered. The hawker was so nice and gave me the wanton noodles saying “It’s okay, just take it. you can come back to pay me tomorrow or another day. You already queued so long. Don’t worry dear.” And she said it with such sincerity which touched me. And what I found inspiring about this was that, even though she was cooking and collecting orders non-stop, she put in the effort to reassure me which really made my day :)Special find: Neurographic art looks really cool and is a very therapeutic activityGrateful for: A chill week with time outside work to draw and practice dancing, that my fellow Thoughtworks new joiners are nice!Something I want to work on: Being more assertive with what I want/ don’t wantTheme of the week: Finding a rhythm; starting work has injected some structure into my daily schedule.

The book presented two scenarios: “A family dog was killed by a car in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog’s body and cooked it and ate it for dinner. Nobody saw them do this.” “A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a chicken. But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it.”The thing about morality is that it is so complex.Just before reading this, I was listening to an episode with Tommy Cladwell (a rock climber) from the podcast “A Slight Change of Plans”. In it, he talked about an experience where he was held hostage and in order to escape, he pushed his captor off the side of a mountain (it wasn’t that high). It got him thinking contemplating his morality – whether he was evil or a hero for doing it. It got me thinking too. The morality of the situation is even harder to evaluate since the boundaries between what was retaliation and what was defense isn’t clear.Morality is so complicated. I wonder if there will ever be advancement in this field and if so, what will that look like? Will it involve moving towards a common morality? Do we even want a common morality? There is a lot of value in grappling with moral questions - it gets us thinking more deeply about what is good and bad. Plus I think achieving a common morality is near impossible - especially with such diverse backgrounds, experiences, and personalities. I guess what is most concerning about not having a common morality is that it could lead to conflict and that there may be a lack of basis to judge the morality of situations. But a stable, safe society can totally have moral disagreements. It is just that they should be handled with due care and there should be respect amongsts people for others(‘ lives).One new idea: I want to create a new feature on this blog that provides readers with a random link (to one of my favorite websites or articles) on the click of a button. But that requires dynamically generating content so I’m not sure if it is possible. Will have to investigate hehI used to really like this Website called Stumbleupon that would bring users to a new webpage on a click of a button. I really want to bring that back :’)Interesting interaction: On Monday I bought Sounds Fishy (a card game) on Carousell. I wasn’t able to get a bargain (not that I tried very hard) so I was a little ambivalent about my decision to buy it. But the conversation with the seller made it worth it. He was quite talkative and after I asked a simple question about his favorite board game, he launched into elaborate recommendations. He recommended high society, snake oil, and funemployed; the first being a strategic trading game and the last two being supposedly hilarious persuasion games (and they certainly sound very fun with lots of room of creativity and the opportunity to brush up on persuasion skills). The conversation later turned to his Chinese and music teachers both of whom inspired in him an interest in their respective subjects. His Chinese teacher would “bait” his class to do their homework by promising to tell them stories if they did and the stories helped improve their Chinese while making them more interested in Chinese literature. His piano teacher who rewarded him by teaching him how to play his favorite songs on the piano. Hmm something about the conversation was really refreshing and I can’t really identify exactly what it was – but perhaps it was his passion for the things he talked about (board games, music), perhaps it was the vibe he gave off – of someone who is truly living and carving out a path he wants, or just the serendipitous interaction with a stranger that really turned into an exchange of ideas, thoughts, and life experiences.Interesting searches:“can you try diving from a 10m diving board singapore” – i really want to try thisSpecial find: This Dark Chocolate Tahini Brownie Recipe [https://soomfoods.com/blogs/recipes/dark-chocolate-sea-salt-brownies?srsltid=AfmBOoo32jnbw9eF9i4YfhJKupMcT8A95PLTm2GokxTHDqz_BJ2fe-n8]I usually find brownies too sweet for my liking but this one isn’t!

There is just not much point in doing that.Perhaps what matters more these days is the questions we ask.

How do unzipping tools work to unzip files? So moving forward, I am also not so sure what I want to write on this blog. I definitely want my posts to have originality so there might be more personal reflections and perhaps the occassional ideas I come up with.To start off, I am going to aim to write a post per week with my consolidated reflections, ideas, learnings for the week starting this Friday! I will be starting work in 2 weeks and I am a little concerned that it will rub away at my individuality, creativity, and spontaneity.

But while reading about Python’s Global Interpreter Lock, I stumbled upon it. This statement got me a bit more interested to know what CUDA is about: “[…] creating a DataLoader after accessing a GPU can lead to confusing CUDA errors.

It got me thinking.Recently I have been thinking more about my transition to adulthood, but in a more “what new habits should I pick up?”, “what new responsibilities should I take on”, “how should I find a balance between work and life, work and doing things I really feel for” kind of way. Is that all the transition to adulthood entails? It could be. But the new responsibilities, habits, the new balance don’t seem to be what constitutes maturity.My step into official adulthood happened in a flurry and I didn’t really make an effort to change any part of my life or myself. I turned 21 the day I flew back from exchange and with all the business of packing and getting onto the plane and the tiredness that followed, I didn’t do much reflection. As the date of starting work draws near, I think it is a good time to start thinking about the topic of maturity.The first response I gave my friend after being asked about what I consider maturity to be was along the lines of “Being more intrinsically guided in one’s actions and a good judgment of when to be extrinsically guided.” An example would be when parents put pressure on someone to follow a certain path, for example, becoming a doctor or lawyer. According to my definition, one who is mature would only follow this path if they have an intrinsic motivation or vision to do so. But maturity comes with sensitivity to extrinsic incentives and pressures such as practical considerations (e.g. will an extrinsic reward help one further move towards one’s bigger goals). In this sense, extrinsic motivation should not be solely for the extrinsic reward, but seen as a step that is helpful for one’s own (intrinsic) goals. I think what prompted me to define maturity in this way yesterday was a quick comparison between people I perceive as more mature and less mature. Thinking a little more about this definition, it seems to boil down to the ability to be discerning.Hmmm but now there is also the question about where intrinsic guidance comes from and if the process of developing this intrinsic guidance matters for maturity. I think all intrinsic guidance is either innate or influenced by one’s environment. One source of intrinsic guidance may be principles instilled either explicitly or implicitly by one’s parents that one adopts and comes to guide one’s actions. These principles may be mixed in with principles from friends, teachers, media, etc. and further taken apart and pieced together through reflection. Maturity calls for being aware of the sources of one’s intrinsic guidance and having a reason for holding a principle/ belief that one is guided by.There is also the question of whether the kind of intrinsic guidance matters. Like if one is intrinsically guided to steal, is that maturity? Well duh, no. For me, mature intrinsic guidance should ultimately be guided by a larger cause one sees for. It somehow seems more mature for intrinsic guidance to be related to working towards a societal problem, something larger than oneself - similar to self-actualization in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.Additionally, maturity requires action and not just rash action, but action that is carefully considered, responsible, and committed to. Sometimes the hardest part (for me) is translating one’s intrinsic guidance into committed action. This part requires a mix of courage, determination, independence, vision, and willingness to overcome obstacles, but also an open mind and the willingness to adapt and re-route when appropriate.My understanding now is that maturity can be seen as good discernment (of likely consequences, of human nature, of a good balance between different extremes) alongside care and responsibility towards others, as well as well thought out action.Notes: This is all written from my perspective. And I believe maturity looks different under different circumstances. The pursuit of self-actualization is not possible for everyone and probably not the most practical/ mature thing to do in some scenarios. But hmm this is another topic I want to think about → how the different needs in Maslow’s hierarchy relate to each other and whether a hierarchy accurately represents their relationship." }, { "title": "Tech interview questions that I was not prepared for", "url": "/posts/tech-interview-questions/", "categories": "Tech", "tags": "tech", "date": "2024-02-08 11:33:00 +0800", "snippet": "I realized that I was very very unprepared going into my first two tech interviewsLessons for next time: Make sure I am able to explain my projects on my resume and the tech decisions I made!
